# BLOOP Theme for Vim

High contrast theme with a minimal, modern color palette.

- dark theme
- true colors support
- 256 colors support
- includes colors for lightline and fzf
- does not set a background color, so that using opacity still works.

## Todo

- [ ] finalize color palette
- [ ] create light variant
- [ ] include color palette for alacritty
- [ ] proper 256 color support?
- [ ] 16 colors support via terminal palette?
- [ ] test with nvim
- [ ] write proper readme
- [ ] colors for bat? (preview in fzf)
- [ ] use t_RB for background color, fallback to defined color to work in gui
    apps (eg neovide)
